# UEF

This is a working repository for a course about Finite-State grammar taught at UEF.

## How to start with Git
1 clone this repository to your own computer. The clone will be your local working repository.
  - open Terminal application
  - find or create the folder into which you want to clone the repository (cd „Folder name” or mkdir ”Folder name“)
  - execute <code>git init<code/>
  - execute <code>git clone https://github.com/meehka/UEF<code/>

2 edit files in the repository locally

3 commit your additions, corrections or other editions to the remote repository
  - go to Terminal application or open it again
  - execute <code>git commit -m "<YOUR LOG MESSAGE>" <FILENAME><code/> 
  - execute <code>git push<code/>
  
The command <code>git push<code/> sends changes that you have made on the file to the remote repository, so that it will be updated for the other users.

Every time **before** you start opening the bibliography on your computer:
- open Terminal application
- go to the folder with your working repository
- execute <code>git pull<code/> (in order to get the newest version)!

The files on your working local repository will be updated with the files on remote repository. 

Make commits often during your work, but especially when you finish (in order not to end up in version conflicts)!

In order to see the list of changed files:
- go to Terminal application or open it again 
- execute <code>git status<code/>

You will get an information about all files, that were changed.
